error: failed to select a version for `linera-sdk`.
    ... required by package `blink v0.1.0 (/Users/immanuelolivia/otsima/Linera/Blink/contracts)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.14` are: 0.14.2, 0.14.1, 0.14.0

package `blink` depends on `linera-sdk` with feature `contract` but `linera-sdk` does not have that feature.


failed to select a version for `linera-sdk` which could resolve this conflict
